# AtomFastStart
A way to start up Atom.io editor with the installed packages I like to use to get going.

## Installing

Once Atom is installed, grab the AtomPackagesList.txt file or clone this repo.

Run this command (remember to specify the path to the txt file if you're not in the directory):

```
apm install --packages-file AtomPackageList.txt
```

Sit back and have tea. :)

## After Installing

Go into your Atom preferences and set the UI & syntax themes to Sophisticated.

## Upcoming Updates

Right now there's one setup file, which is all the packages I use for front-end development with JS/React/etc. I'm thinking about making a few packs in the future:

1. Everything
2. Front-end React
3. Python development
4. Golang development
